There are 2 parts to the code. Front end HTML is manually deployed via Netlify everytime I make a code change. In the HTML file that has to link to the google apps script. 
You will see a blank CONFIG.API variable in the HTML that you will have to fill in with the deployment ID from your google apps script.

For the .gs file. This is the Google Apps script that I run from https://script.google.com/home. It is missing key variables that I redacted as this is public. You will need
an ODDS API Key from here: https://the-odds-api.com/ and a google sheets SHEET ID so responses from the form can be saved to google sheets.
